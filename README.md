# Ignition Module Tools

This repository holds a number of tools that are used to create and/or support the creation of modules intended for Inductive Automation's Ignition platform.

## Contents

Contains three subprojects.  See the linked readmes for details

1. A plugin for the [Gradle](https://www.gradle.org) build system which provides the ability to assemble valid Ignition modules.

1. [Ignition Module Generator Core](https://github.com/inductiveautomation/ignition-module-tools/tree/master/generator/generator-core#readme) library for creating Ignition module skeletons.  Written in Kotlin, usable in Kotlin, Java and other JVM languages via jar-based dependency available as Maven artifacts.

2. [Module Generator CLI](https://github.com/inductiveautomation/ignition-module-tools/tree/master/generator/generator-cli#readme) command line application which uses the generator library to provide a _command line interface_ (CLI) that can be used to create modules from your operating system's terminal/console.


#### See the README.md in the appropriate subproject for more information about that project.

## Requirements

The only requirement is an appropriate JDK (JDK 11 as of writing) available on the system path.

# How to Build

This repo is structured as a multi-project [gradle](http://gradle.org) build. It includes the gradlew wrapper scripts for linux/mac/windows to enable dependency-free assembly.  All gradle commands should be executed using the wrapper appropriate for the platform being built on.  This generally means executing tasks via `gradlew.bat` for Windows, and the `gradlew` script on Linux/Mac.  Note that a build on Windows, Mac or Linux will output artifacts useful for all supported platforms, regardless of which platform the build is executed on.  However, the native image binaries of the CLI subproject are only created for the platform on which the build runs, and this must be executed on each platform for which a binary is desired.

To build all projects, from the root of the repository:

```
// windows
gradlew.bat build

// mac/linux
./gradlew build

```

The output of each assembly will exist in the local subproject's `build` directory, which is created during build
execution.  A specific/individual project can be built by executing `./gradlew build` in the appropriate project
subdirectory.


To see a list of all available tasks, run `./gradlew tasks` (`gradlew.bat tasks` on Windows).
